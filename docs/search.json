A linear modeling framework quantifies each factor’s influence on future growth."

How do fertility, mortality, and migration assumptions shape these projections?\nWe can Analyse this using comparison bar chart as shown in Figure 4:\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Projected population of Australia from 2017 to 2066 under medium fertility, mortality, and migration assumptions. The High scenario consistently projects the largest population, driven by higher fertility and migration, while the Low scenario shows slower growth due to reduced births and zero net migration."
