# 📊 Population Projection Analysis (Australia)

## Project Overview
This project presents a **reproducible demographic analysis of Australian population projections** using **R** and **Quarto**.  
It examines how population size and growth patterns evolve over time under different **fertility, mortality, and migration assumptions**, based on official Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) projection scenarios.

The project demonstrates an end-to-end analytical workflow, from data preparation to publication-ready outputs suitable for web and PDF dissemination.
